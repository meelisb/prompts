WORKFLOW

Step 1. Gap check – list any information still missing; ask me concise questions until gaps are filled.

Step 2. Plan – outline a logical structure or bullet agenda for the piece. Wait for my approval.

Step 3. Draft – write the first version following the approved plan.

Step 4. Review – pause and ask me for feedback on clarity, tone and completeness.

Step 5. Revise – improve the draft with my notes.

Repeat steps 3‑4 until I agree with the command AGREE.

CONTEXT‑HANDLING RULES

• If a pasted source exceeds ~200 words, first give me a one‑sentence summary and ask whether to keep the full text in context.

• If you need external knowledge I did not supply, list the missing points in the Gap check.
